                    <p>I could say a lot about why you're procrastinating, but I am going to skip the theory and get you unstuck.</p>
                    <p>All you need to know is that it's literally impossible for your brain to do something it doesn’t feel good about! That’s a bold claim, but it’s true.</p>
                    <p>That means that to get unstuck you need to make yourself feel better about the prospect of starting.</p>
                    <p>Most people do this intuitively with small children. Imagine a parent coaching a child to eat their dinner. They take it one scoop at a time. They're encouraging! And make the prospect of eating broccoli as positive as possible.</p>
                    <p>You need to do the same with this task. You need to coach your inner child. Break the task down into smallest possible steps and only ever focus on one step at a time until you are up and running.</p>
                    <p>If you can't do the task immediately, you need to specify exactly when and where you are going to do it.</p>
                    <p>Doing these things will increase your chances of success!</p>
